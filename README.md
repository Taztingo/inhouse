Brief -
A collection of inhouse projects in C++11 to keep me busy during Winter 2013.
All code will be created from scratch and built upon, starting with String.
I will be basing my class implementation/methods off of Java's.
The objective is to simply keep my mind fresh, and hopefully have a set of
useful tools to build future projects.
